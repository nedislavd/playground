## nextNum()
- Implement the method nextNum() and a minimal but effective set of unit tests. Implement in the language of your choice, Python is preferred,
but Java and other languages are completely fine. Make sure your code is exemplary, as if it was going to be shipped as part of a production
system.

- As a quick check, given Random Numbers are [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and Probabilities are [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01] if we call nextNum() 100 times
  we may get the following results. As the results are random, these particular results are unlikely.

-1: 1 times \
 0: 22 times \
 1: 57 times \
 2: 20 times \
 3: 0 times
